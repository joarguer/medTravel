# Changelog Decisions

## Decision: Introduce Stage 2 commission unlock system

**Rationale**
MedTravel must monetize provider-client matches while preserving free negotiation inside the platform.

**Outcome**
Stage 1 communication remains open, but sensitive provider contact details are gated behind commission payment.

**Notes**
Stripe integration scaffolding added for future payment processing.

## Decision: Introduce configurable commission per provider

**Rationale**
Different providers may have different commercial agreements with MedTravel.

**Outcome**
Commission parameters are stored per provider and enforced through the Stage 2 commission gate.
